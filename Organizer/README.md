## How to prep it?

Edit the cli.py file and in the top of the first function there is a path variable,
modify it to whatever folder path you want it to monitor for new files 

And in the same path you put in that variable in that folder make some folders with the names PDF, PICTURES, TEXT-DOCS, MS-WORD-DOCS, EXECUTABLES, PYTHON-FILES and you can add more files types and folder so enjoy

Open a terminal in the same folder with the setup.py

And type 'pip install --editable .' and press enter

And then your done, just open any terminal and type 'organize'
and it should do the rest for you.
