## Setup

For now this only works on windows.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install organize.

Create a folder on your desktop and and open a command prompt window and type 
```bash
cd Desktop
```
afterwards type cd <Your folder name>:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:PamTheSpam/Organizer.git
```
and then press enter

Open the cli.py file and at the very top there is a cli function in top of the funciton there is a variable called 'path' you need to modify the variable so it contains the path to a folder to organize. For now it only organizes text files, pictures, python files, executables, microsoft word docs and pdf

## Installation

In the same cmd window you typed the git clone command type:
```bash
cd Organizer
```
And again type:
```bash
cd Organizer
```
And to finnaly install it type:
```bash
pip install --editable .
```

## Usage

Once installed go to any terminal just type:
```bash
organize
```
