## Setup

Open the cli.py file and at the very top there is a cli function and at the very top there is a variable called path and modify the variable so it contains the path to a folder to organize. For now it only organizes text files, pictures, python files, executables, microsoft word docs and pdf

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install organize.

Create a folder on your desktop and open a powershell terminal in the folder by clicking shift + right click and press 'open powershell window here' or just cd into the folder and type 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:PamTheSpam/Organizer.git
and then press enter
```
after cd into the same folder that contains the setup.py and type:
```bash
pip install --editable .
```

## Usage

Once installed go to any terminal just type:
```bash
organize
```
